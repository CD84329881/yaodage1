The ESCON configuration files are identical except that the hall sensor analog output port is swapped for M3.
This was done because ADC2 cannot be used reliably when WiFi is also active on the ESP32, supposedly.
A future revision of the motherboard will connect analog out 1 of each motor controller to ADC1 to resolve this.
